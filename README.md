# Text Editor (PWA) 

## Description

This is a text editor application that works both online and offline. It can create and edit texts with or without an internet connection. It uses the uses cache and API's to do just that, and remain fully functional barring an internet connection. The purpose for building this project is for those that need this application to be able to use it no matter where they are and if they do or do not have an internet connection. I learned how to build server and client side files to create an application that functions without an internet connection. 


## Installation

This application can be used by first cloning the repo and running npm i in the integrated terminal. It will give you access to packaages like express, babel, webpack, webpack dev server, webpack pwa manifest, css loader, concurrently, and indexedDb.
